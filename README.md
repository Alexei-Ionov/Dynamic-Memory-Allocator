Engineered dynamic memory allocation, allowing user programs to request memory from the OS via sbrk, and implemented malloc, realloc, and free on the backend in the kernel to run an efficient memory allocator that prevents fragmentation. The memory allocator uses a first-fit algorithm to find the `first` block of heap memory which can hold the requested amount of space from the user.
